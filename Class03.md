#### 1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?
In a complex query-intensive environment, SQL databases are generally considered to be a better fit. SQL databases excel at handling structured data and complex queries that involve multiple tables and relationships. They have a well-defined schema and support powerful querying languages like SQL, which allows for efficient and optimized execution of complex queries.



#### 2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?
Graph databases are the best fit for hierarchical data storage among NoSQL databases. Graph databases are specifically designed to handle and represent complex hierarchical relationships efficiently. They store data in nodes and edges, making it easy to navigate and query hierarchical data structures. Graph databases excel at traversing and querying relationships, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation of hierarchical data. Therefore, if you are considering a NoSQL database for hierarchical data storage, a graph database is often the most suitable choice.
