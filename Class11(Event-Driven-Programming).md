#### 1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

The EventEmitter

#### 2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

The combination of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Event-Driven Programming (EDP) offers valuable advantages. OOP facilitates code organization by encapsulating data and behavior into objects. When used alongside EDP, it enables the creation of modular and maintainable event-driven systems. Objects represent entities, and events trigger specific methods or functions within those objects, simplifying event handling and ensuring code coherence. This approach helps manage complexity and promotes a structured and manageable codebase.



#### 3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Event Driven Programming in the backend with Node.js helps us efficiently handle multiple requests, write modular and reusable code, and easily integrate with external services. It enables us to build scalable and responsive applications that can handle a large number of users and complex operations.
