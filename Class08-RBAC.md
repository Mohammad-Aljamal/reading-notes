##  RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)



### [5 steps to RBAC](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)

#### 1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization.
RBAC provides several benefits for organizations. It offers granular access control by assigning roles to users based on their responsibilities, simplifying administration and ensuring scalability. RBAC enhances security and compliance by reducing the risk of unauthorized access, supporting separation of duties, and facilitating auditing. Additionally, it increases productivity by providing users with the appropriate level of access they need to perform their job functions effectively. Overall, RBAC improves security, streamlines administration, ensures compliance, and boosts productivity in organizations.


#### 2. Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
Permissions to modify data (e.g., read, write, full access).
Permission to access company applications.
Permissions inside an application.

#### 3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
1- Inventory your systems
2- Analyze your workforce and create roles
3- Assign people to roles
4- Never make one-off changes
5- Audit


### [wiki - RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)

#### 1. If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?
RBAC simplifies authorization by associating permissions with roles rather than individual users, enabling centralized management and scalability. This approach ensures that users have appropriate access levels aligned with their job functions while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. RBAC enhances security, compliance, and efficiency in access control within an organization.

#### 2. Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.
1- Role Assignment.
2- Role Authorization.
3- Role Permissions.

#### 3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
If we have a company with different departments and each person requires an access card to enter any department, the manager have an access card that grants access to all departments. Employees of the sales department have access cards that allow them entry into their specific department only. However, any unauthorized or unemployeed person should not be able to enter the company premises without a valid access card.

#### 1. What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.
The role of the user which was given to him based on his function in the organization, the role which determines what type of user this is.

#### 2. Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?
the users must be activated to one or more roles in order to get access rights.

#### 3. Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.
It would benefit a business by organizing the users roles for them and giving them the least previlage to access resources in the organization which will basically implement a hierarchy based on access right to serve the organizaation.
