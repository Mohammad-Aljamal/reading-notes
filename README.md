#### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
Node is a platform that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's like a powerful engine that lets developers build web applications and other software using JavaScript, the same language used for websites. Node brings speed, scalability, and flexibility to create fast and efficient applications, making it a popular choice in the developer community.

#### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
When we say Node is a JavaScript runtime, it means that Node provides an environment where JavaScript code can be executed outside of a web browser. It allows developers to run JavaScript on servers, which traditionally used languages like PHP or Java. Node's runtime includes the necessary components and libraries to interpret and execute JavaScript code, making it possible to build powerful and scalable server-side applications using JavaScript as the primary language.

#### What is Node used for?
Node is used for building server-side applications and APIs, creating real-time applications, and handling network-related tasks. It excels at handling concurrent connections and performing non-blocking I/O operations, making it suitable for applications that require high scalability and responsiveness, such as web servers, chat applications, streaming services, and data-intensive applications.
