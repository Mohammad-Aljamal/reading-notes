# Data Structures and Algorithms


#### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
When deciding on a data structure for a specific problem, one important consideration is the efficiency of operations required. Factors such as insertion and deletion frequency, search and retrieval needs, random access requirements, memory usage, and specific problem constraints should be evaluated to determine the most suitable data structure. By understanding the problem's operational demands, you can choose a data structure that optimizes performance and solves the problem efficiently.


#### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, it is crucial to implement a proper termination condition in the recursive function that explicitly defines when the recursion should stop. Additionally, ensure that each recursive call progresses towards the termination condition, such that the problem size decreases or changes with each call. It is important to modify the problem parameters appropriately in each recursive call to ensure progress towards the base case. By carefully managing these aspects of the recursive algorithm, you can prevent infinite recursion and ensure the termination of the call stack.
